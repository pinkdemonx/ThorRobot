-Robot mobilty: Round 1 programming

-Directional Motor: (D): direction in degrees of the movement. 

-Motion motor (A): Uniform motion of the robot. 

-General description: 
The robot is made up of two motors, motor A will move to the indicated direction in rotations and 
will stop completely at the desired point to adjust the direction it will take when turning, 
when this condition is met motor B in charge of constant movement will start. will turn on, 
causing the robot to move until it makes 3 laps around the track.

Objective as future engineers:
Participating in this tournament and being recognized as future engineers represents a significant
milestone in our professional and personal development. As a "ThorRobot" team, our aspiration is
much more than simply competing; We wish to use this experience as a platform to hone our skills 
in designing, building and programming robotic systems. Programming is not just a tool for us, but
a way to approach and solve complex problems in a creative and innovative way.
Since the beginning of this project, we have been immersed in a constant learning process. Every 
challenge we face provides us with an opportunity to apply and expand our engineering
knowledge, as we seek to exceed the expectations and limitations placed on us. Our passion for
technology and its potential to transform the world drives us to go beyond traditional capabilities
and explore new frontiers in the field of robotics.
Our goal is not simply to meet tournament requirements, but to demonstrate a level of
competence and creativity that reflects our commitment and dedication.
Throughout this journey, we have spent countless hours researching, designing and programming 
a robot that not only meets the tournament criteria, but also represents our vision and aspirations 
as engineers. We have learned to face unexpected challenges, adapt our strategies and refine our
processes.
